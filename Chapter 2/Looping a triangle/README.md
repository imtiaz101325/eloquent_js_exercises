# Looping a triangle
  Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following

```
  triangle:
  #
  ##
  ###
  ####
  #####
  ######
  #######
```

  It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by
writing .length after it.

```js
  var abc = " abc ";
  console . log ( abc . length ) ;
  // â†’ 3
```
